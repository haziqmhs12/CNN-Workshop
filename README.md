# Vehicle vs Non-Vehicle Classification using Custom CNN

A deep learning project built during the **CNN Architectures in Industrial Applications** workshop organized by **Advanced Semiconductor Academy of Malaysia (ASEM)**.

## üß† Overview

This project was completed during a **5-day intensive workshop** held over the semester break, organized by the **Advanced Semiconductor Academy of Malaysia (ASEM)**.

The workshop focused on CNN architectures and real-world AI applications. We explored and built multiple CNN models to classify images as **vehicle** or **non-vehicle**, achieving **98% accuracy** using a custom 3-layer CNN.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab

## üß™ Experiments
| CNN Architecture               | Accuracy |
|--------------------------------|----------|
| 5-layer CNN                    | ~84%     |
| 3-layer CNN (without tune)     | ~90%     |
| 3-layer CNN (After tune)       | **98%**  |

## üìä Dataset

We used the [Vehicle Detection Image Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brsdincer/vehicle-detection-image-set) from Kaggle.

The dataset contains:
- **Vehicle images:** 1,000+
- **Non-vehicle images:** 1,000+

Each image is a 100x100 JPG file, pre-categorized into:
- `/vehicles/`
- `/non-vehicles/`
