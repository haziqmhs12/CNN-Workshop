# Vehicle vs Non-Vehicle Classification using Custom CNN

A deep learning project built during the **CNN Architectures in Industrial Applications** workshop organized by **Advanced Semiconductor Academy of Malaysia (ASEM)**.

## üß† Overview
This project involves building and optimizing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to classify images as **vehicle** or **non-vehicle**. Through experimentation with various CNN architectures, we found that a custom **3-layer CNN** achieved the best results with **98% accuracy**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab

## üß™ Experiments
| CNN Architecture               | Accuracy |
|--------------------------------|----------|
| 5-layer CNN                    | ~84%     |
| 3-layer CNN (without tune)     | ~95%     |
| 3-layer CNN (After tune)       | **98%**  |
